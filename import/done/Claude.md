## Key Limitations

### Knowledge Cutoff
- Training data has a specific cutoff date, limiting knowledge of recent events
- Cannot access real-time information or browse the internet
- May provide outdated information on rapidly evolving topics

### No Internet Access or Tool Use
- Cannot retrieve current information or verify facts in real-time
- Limited to knowledge from training data
- Cannot perform web searches or access external databases

### Conservative Approach
- Sometimes overly cautious in responses due to safety training
- May refuse legitimate requests that could be interpreted as harmful
- Can be less adventurous in creative tasks compared to other models

### Limited Multimodal Capabilities
- Primarily text-focused (though newer versions support image input)
- Less advanced multimodal integration compared to some competitors
- Limited audio or video processing capabilities

### Computational Requirements
- Requires significant computational resources for inference
- Higher latency compared to smaller, more efficient models
- Cost considerations for high-volume usage

### Market Position
- Newer entrant compared to established players like OpenAI
- Smaller ecosystem of third-party tools and integrations
- Less widespread adoption in enterprise environments

## Use Cases Where Claude Excels
- Research and analysis requiring careful reasoning
- Content creation and editing with high quality standards
- Educational applications where safety is paramount
- Complex problem-solving and logical analysis
- Code review and programming assistance
